Jetpack Compose Profile Card UI Challenge
=====================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains my submission for the Jetpack Compose Profile Card UI Challenge. The challenge was to create a profile card UI that displays a user's profile information using Rows, Columns, and Text elements.

Requirements:
--------

1. Display the user's profile picture at the top center of the card.
2. Below the profile picture, display the user's name centered horizontally.
3. Below the name, display the user's bio text with a maximum of two lines, centered horizontally.
4. Add an icon (e.g., email icon) aligned to the left and a corresponding email address aligned to the right on the same row below the bio text.
5. Add a button at the bottom of the card, centered horizontally, labeled "View Profile".
